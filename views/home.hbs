      Specializing in responsive "mobile first" design and development practices, I
      strive to ensure each page I make is lightweight and feels at home on any size screen.

    <p class='sectiontext'>
      By incorporating .svg and other next gen graphic formats in conjunction with the img srcset
      attribute I typically reduce a pages normal loads speeds by over 60%!  This is important
      for all the landing pages where you might see an ad turned down due to excessive load time.

       There is no other way to get to know your online clients better than Google
       Analytics.  By observing and studing the incredible amount of information that
       Google Analytics contains you can easily where your efforts are making great strides
       and where they are coming back with weak, or negative, returns.
    </p>
    <p id='analyticsExp' class='sectiontext'>
       My experience in adding, maintaining, and analyzing data to/from Google Analytics has
       assisted in creating some of the best performing landing pages they have ever had. Before,
       our average landing page had over 70% bounce rate and 75% exit rates; now both bounce and
       exit rates are less than 50% with some being as low as 2%.
